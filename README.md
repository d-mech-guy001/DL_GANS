# DL_GANS
A starting point to understand the basic structure and training process of a GAN in Python using TensorFlow and Keras

Here, we define a generator and a discriminator using TensorFlow's Keras API. The generator takes random noise as input and generates fake images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. The generator and discriminator are then combined to form the GAN model.

The steps included in the training are:

Randomly select a batch of real images from the MNIST dataset.
Generate a batch of fake images using the generator.
Train the discriminator to correctly classify real and fake images.
Train the generator to fool the discriminator by generating more realistic images.
Periodically print the loss and generate a sample of generated images for visualization.

The visualization part generates a 5x5 grid of images at regular intervals, showing the progress of the generator in generating realistic digits.
